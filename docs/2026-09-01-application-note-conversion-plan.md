# Application Note conversion plan (2026-09-01)

Decision context: shared-range accuracy is honestly non-leading (ULTRA
first by ~1pp), so the publishable claim is **capability** — one pass over
periods 1 bp–2,000 bp at a 1.77–1.82× cost (mean 1.79) for a 20× wider
range, with the
only tractable >500 bp coverage — not superiority. The Application Note
format sells exactly that; the full-paper track stays viable at venues that
value the benchmark methodology itself (venue analysis pending; this plan
is venue-agnostic and parameterized where formats differ).

## What survives in the main text (~1,100–1,300 words + 2 display items)

1. **One paragraph of problem + claim.** Existing period-capped detectors
   force per-range re-runs; the wide-range single pass is the contribution.
   State ULTRA-first plainly in the same breath as the 1pp gap and the 20×
   range — the abstract already does this; compress it.
2. **Figure 1 = current Fig 2 (range–cost).** Panels: paired 100→2,000 bp
   release-build runs (1.77–1.82×; mean 1.79); maize ULTRA/TRF scaling;
   human core-hours/memory dot plots. This is the value proposition. If the running ULTRA `-p 2000`
   measurement (job 6145581) lands before submission, its wall clock (or
   documented non-completion) becomes the killer annotation on panel C.

   The earlier 1.30–1.41× BWTandem estimate is superseded. All of its pairs
   ran at `07ad6fa`, where the narrow arm still performed and discarded the
   long-period Tier 3 search, making that comparison too favourable.
3. **Figure 2 = current Fig 1 (shared-range accuracy).** P/B/F/H curve +
   competitors + overlap-rule robustness. Keeps us honest and preempts the
   "you hid the ranking" review.
4. **One results paragraph** citing: full-range region recall 80.53% /
   held-out 80.48%; matched-range BWT 78.87 vs ULTRA 81.62; the >100 bp
   stratum (3.43% of catalog, structurally absent from range-capped
   tools); Col-CEN 99.72% monomer recall in 40 min; the specificity audit
   in one sentence (4/400 supported — unmatched calls are predominantly
   over-calls).
5. **Availability/repro paragraph**: pip/conda install, deposited BEDs,
   hashed manifests, per-cell provenance.

## What moves to the supplement (all of it already exists)

- Tables 1a–1e, 2, 3A–3C and their long caveat prose (currently the bulk
  of the manuscript body).
- S1 (tool versions), S2 (unique-call characterisation), S3 (identity
  sweep), S4 (strict one-to-one panels).
- Figures 3 (sweep + audit), 4 (plant satellites), S1 (chromosome-subset),
  S2 (post-merge trade-off).
- The full Methods 2.1–2.2 text; the main text keeps two-sentence
  summaries with pointers.

## What gets cut nowhere (non-negotiables)

The retractions and limitations stay wherever their claims appear: the
audit result, the 28.08 GB memory, fragmentation, ULTRA-first under every
overlap rule, the S4 corrections trail. An Application Note with a public
evidence repo cannot afford a single suppressed cell.

## Mechanical work list (when the author picks the venue)

1. Freeze the full manuscript as `manuscript_full.md` (supplement source).
2. Write the ~1,300-word main text per the outline above; port the
   two figures once Filip's implementations land (HANDOFF_FILIP.md).
3. Re-cut the abstract to the venue limit; keep "non-leading shared-range
   accuracy" verbatim.
4. Update `results/manifest.tsv` table ids if table numbering changes
   (S-numbers stay stable if the supplement keeps current numbering — do
   that).
5. Citation/format conversion via the venue's template.

## Open inputs

- Venue analysis (running): format limits per venue, precedent papers,
  reviewer-pool risk.
- ~~ULTRA `-p 2000` (job 6145581): the last cell of the range-cost story.~~
  Resolved 2026-09-02: terminated incomplete after 1 d 22 h with ~4% of the
  assembly processed (chr1 to 124.8 Mb); recorded as manifest row
  `ULTRA-p2000-attempt`, Methods 2.2, Results 3.1 and
  `results/range_cost_attempts/`.
- Title decision (5 candidates pending) — should name the capability, not
  a superiority claim.
