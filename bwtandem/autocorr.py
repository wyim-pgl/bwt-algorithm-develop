"""Shared autocorrelation primitives for periodicity detection.

Three detection paths independently re-derived the same "how self-similar is the
sequence at offset ``period``" computation:

  - ``finder._fill_satellite_gaps``   — a scalar identity per (window, period)
  - ``finder._catchall_periodicity_fill`` — a cumsum-based sliding-window count
  - ``tier2._autocorr_seed``          — the identical cumsum sliding-window count

This module factors those out so the period-detection math lives in one place.
It is no longer a behavior-preserving copy of the inline code it replaced: the
ambiguity rule below was added, and ``_cumsum_windows`` fixes an off-by-one that
dropped the last full window (and returned ``None`` when exactly one existed).

All functions take a 1-D ``uint8`` view of the sequence (e.g. ``BWTCore.text_arr``).

Ambiguous bases
---------------
Sequences reach these functions uppercased, with assembly gaps and (under
``--mask soft``/``both``) masked regions written as ``N``; the BWT sentinel
``$`` can also be in view. Raw equality counts ``N == N`` as a match, so a run
of ``N`` is trivially "periodic" at *every* period and scores identity 1.0.
That is how solid-``N`` motifs were emitted at telomeres, and a motif-only
guard does not stop it: an A/C/G/T motif at the start of a window is enough to
authorize a call that then spans an ``N``-rich block.

So comparisons where either side is not A/C/G/T are excluded by default
(``ignore_ambiguous=True``) rather than counted as agreement, and
``autocorr_identity`` additionally refuses to score a window that does not have
enough valid comparisons to judge. Pass ``ignore_ambiguous=False`` for the
plain arithmetic.
