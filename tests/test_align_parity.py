"""The C alignment accelerator and the pure-Python loop must agree.

`MotifUtils.align_repeat_region` runs `libalign_accel`'s C loop when it loads and
its own Python loop otherwise, so the two must return the same summary or the
tool's answer depends on whether a build artefact happens to be present.

They did not. Measured 2026-07-09 on 1500 random repeat regions, they disagreed
on 31% of them, from three causes:

  * `align_accel.c` read uninitialised heap in its traceback (column 0 of the
    pointer table was written to a scratch row, not to the table the traceback
    reads), which also made the whole caller nondeterministic;
  * its extension bound was `end + 3*motif_len + 4*max_indel` where the Python
    loop used `max(end, start + motif_len*min_copies) + max(3*motif_len, 4*max_indel)`;
  * `_consensus_from_counts` broke ties by insertion order while the C — and
    `build_consensus_motif_array` — take the lexicographically smallest base.
    A different consensus cascades into every later copy's alignment.

With all three fixed the disagreement is zero. This test keeps it there.
