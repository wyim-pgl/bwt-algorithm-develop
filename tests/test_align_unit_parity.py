"""`align_unit_to_window`: the Cython loop and the Python banded DP must agree.

Why this exists (2026-08-06): of the five accelerator symbols the tiers consume, this
was the only one with no C-vs-Python value comparison — `test_accel_parity.py:151`
checks that the binding exists, not that it returns the same thing. That gap mattered
more than the others because this symbol's Python counterpart is a separate,
hand-written banded DP (`motif_utils.py:273-424`), the same code shape as the
`align_accel.c` loop that disagreed with its twin on 31% of random regions until
2026-07-09 (see `docs/2026-07-09-nondeterminism-uninitialised-ptr-table.md`).

The two implementations agree on all 2000 generated cases today, so this is a
regression guard rather than a bug report. Cases are drawn to hit the paths that
matter: clean repeats, single and multi-base deletions, insertions, and substitution
clusters, each followed by a random tail so the window is longer than the motif.
