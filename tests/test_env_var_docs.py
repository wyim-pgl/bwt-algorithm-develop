"""Every tuning knob the code reads must be documented, and vice versa.

Why this exists (2026-08-05): `CATCHALL_MAX_SEEDS` was documented in CLAUDE.md with
a stated default of 200000 and did not exist anywhere in the source. Anyone setting
it got silence — no error, no effect, and a plausible-looking knob in the docs to
explain a result it had no part in. In the other direction `TIER1_FMSCAN` was absent
from the tuning documentation while being set to 1 by *every* benchmark run in the
project, including the one behind the published figures; the manuscript's "Tier 1
used FM-index enumeration mode" is that knob, and a reader had no way to find it.

Both directions are failures of the same kind: the documented interface and the real
interface drifted apart, silently. This test pins them together.

If this fails, do not edit the test to make it pass. Either document the new knob in
CLAUDE.md's "Tuning detection sensitivity (env vars)" section with its default, or
delete the documentation for the knob that no longer exists.
