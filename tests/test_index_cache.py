"""Regression tests for the on-disk FM-index cache.

The cache exists so a parameter sweep pays for the suffix array once instead of
once per configuration. That is only safe if a loaded index is indistinguishable
from a freshly built one, and if a cache that does not match the sequence is
refused rather than used. Both are tested here, along with the failure modes that
would otherwise corrupt results silently: a truncated file, a foreign sequence of
the same length, and a stale format version.
