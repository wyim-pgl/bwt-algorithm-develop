"""The compiled and pure-Python accelerator paths must agree, byte for byte.

`bwtandem/accelerators.py` binds `extend_with_mismatches`, `find_periodic_runs` and
friends to the Cython extension when it is importable and to Python fallbacks
otherwise. Those fallbacks used to be degenerate stubs — `return None` and
`return []` — so a build without the extension detected zero Tier-2 and zero
Tier-3 repeats and exited 0. Nothing caught it: the Tier-2/3 ground-truth cases
were skipped precisely when the extension was missing.

These tests run the whole pipeline twice over the fixtures, once per path, and
require the emitted BED and TRF output to be identical. Each run needs its own
process because `accelerators` binds its symbols at import time.
