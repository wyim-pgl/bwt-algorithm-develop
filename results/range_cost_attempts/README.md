# Matched-ceiling competitor attempts (range-cost, human GRCh38)

BWTandem searches 1–2,000 bp on every genome. Two post-hoc attempts were made
to run the competitors at that same ceiling on human, so that the range-cost
comparison of Results 3.1 would have a competitor arm. Neither completed. Both
are recorded in `results/manifest.tsv` under `table = range-cost`, in Methods
2.2 and Results 3.1 of the manuscript, and in Supplementary Table S1.

| Attempt | Job | Threads | Elapsed at termination | Progress at termination | Manifest row |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TRF 4.10.0rc2, `MAXP 2000` | 6076847 | 1 | 6 d 13 h 57 m (6.6 d; 4.7×† its 33.7 h 500 bp run) | partial `-ngs` output, 379,077 lines | `TRF-p2000-attempt` |
| ULTRA 1.2.1, `-t 2 -p 2000` | 6145581 | 2 | 1 d 22 h 15 m (1.55×† its 29.8 h 100 bp run) | 138,425 calls, all on chr1 (NC_000001.11) up to 124,785,432 bp in complete records, plus one truncated fragment ending at 124,786,615; output did not grow during the final 5 h | `ULTRA-p2000-attempt` |

**† Neither ratio is a speed ratio.** Both divide a **terminated partial** run by a
**completed** one — neither output establishes the fraction of input processed — so they bound the cost from below and
nothing more. Both denominators are inherited GNU-time figures. Their SLURM
accounting no longer exists (manuscript Section 2.2.1), but the GNU-time logs that
produced them do survive and are quoted below and in
`results/comparator_baselines.md`.

The row values not drawn from the manifest come from: the TRF 500 bp wall clock,
its surviving GNU-time log (`…/benchmarking_results/trf/logs/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_genomic_run.log`,
33:43:46); the 14-day ceiling, the `cpu-s1-pgl-0` partition's `TIME_LIMIT` as
reported by `squeue`.

## `ultra_p2000/`

- `run_ultra_human_p2000.sbatch`: the submitted script. It matches the published
  human ULTRA invocation (`ultra -t 2 -o OUT.tsv FASTA`, ULTRA 1.2.1, the same
  assembly sequence content) except for `-p 2000`; its FASTA uses
  different accession headers from the published GCA file. **The execution also differs beyond the
  period:** this run used a local installation of
  the binary, whereas the published run ran inside the Singularity sandbox. The
  two match in self-reported version and sequence content, not in binary
  identity, FASTA bytes or execution environment.

  The published run's GNU-time log survives at
  `/data/gpfs/assoc/pgl/filip/bwtandem_results/benchmarking_results/ultra/logs/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_genomic_run.log`
  and records `singularity exec ./bwtbench.sif ultra -t 2 -o …
  GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_genomic.fna` with an elapsed time of **29:46:49**,
  which is the 29.8 h the manuscript quotes. (A second human ULTRA log, for the
  RefSeq-flavoured `GCF_000001405.26`, records 27:24:19; the manifest and the
  tables use the GCA run.) `bwtbench.sif` is a writable sandbox **directory**,
  not an image file, so its binary can be compared directly:

  | | path | size | SHA-256 of first MB |
  |---|---|--:|---|
  | published | `…/filip/bwt/bwtbench.sif/opt/ULTRA/ultra` | 638,912 | `f11b614f2858f9f0…` |
  | this attempt | `~/micromamba/bin/ultra` | 573,672 | `a475843c1879aeb5…` |

  Different files, both **self-reporting** version 1.2.1 — which is a matched
  version string, not proof of matched code, since two builds can report the same
  string. Read the pair as invocation- and input-matched, with the version taken
  on the binaries' own word. An earlier draft of this README and of Methods 2.2
  called them "the same binary"; that was wrong and was corrected in `24cd12a`,
  and the table above is the evidence.
- `ultra_h_p2000_6145581.log`: provenance header plus an hourly
  `PROGRESS ... out_bytes=` marker (output-file size; ULTRA writes through a
  4 KB stdio buffer, so the size is a coarse progress proxy). Growth was steady
  at roughly 100–470 KB per hour for the first 41 h, then zero from 10:05 until
  the cancellation at 15:20 on 2026-09-02. The last emitted calls
  (124.74–124.79 Mb, periods 169–340 bp) lie in the chromosome 1
  centromeric alpha-satellite region. This does not locate the stall itself.
- `ultra_human_p2000.tsv.settings`: ULTRA's own parameter dump for the run
  (`max_period: 2000`, `threads: 2`, everything else default).

The partial output itself (`ultra_human_p2000.tsv`, 9,781,248 bytes, 138,426
newline characters including the header, first-megabyte SHA-256 `c30692f4351e9a0d…`) stays
on the cluster at
`/data/gpfs/assoc/pgl/devel/exp1_human/regen/ultra_p2000/ultra_human_p2000.tsv`,
the path the manifest records, and is hashed in
`results/external_evidence.sha256`; it is not scored. Note that the manifest's
`lines` field for this row is the raw line count, 138,426, one more than the
138,425 complete calls. A final six-field fragment has no terminating newline
and is excluded from that count; its End field is not the endpoint of the last
complete call. This row points at ULTRA's own TSV rather than a converted BED.

SLURM accounting (`sacct -j 6145581`): CANCELLED by the user at
2026-09-02T15:20:13, Elapsed 1-22:15:07, batch-step MaxRSS 17,972,740 K.
The manifest's convention divides that by 1024², giving 17.14 — strictly GiB,
since sacct's K is KiB, and the same holds for every memory figure in the
manifest and the manuscript tables. The published 100 bp run's 1.68 comes from
GNU time's own KiB field (1,758,540 kB) under the same conversion, so the two
share a unit but **not** a method, a build, or an environment: cgroup peak
versus GNU-time peak, local binary versus sandbox binary. The gap between them
is not a measured memory regression and should not be read as one.

The cancellation was a decision, not a failure: the run had produced no new output for five hours.
An extrapolation from the last emitted coordinate to the 3,209,286,105-base
assembly motivated cancellation, but emitted coordinates do not measure
processed sequence or establish a completion time.

The TRF attempt has a raw cancellation record in `../sacct_provenance.txt`
and a partial `-ngs` file at
`/data/gpfs/assoc/pgl/devel/exp1_human/wp0/fixcampaign/trf_hg38_p2000.ngs.dat`,
the path the manifest records.
