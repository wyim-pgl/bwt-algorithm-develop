# Regenerated benchmark evidence

These files support the manuscript rows regenerated from clean source commit
`0363d8b`.

- `regen_{colcen,human,maize}.provenance.json`: run configuration, inputs, and
  execution provenance for SLURM jobs 6110900, 6110901, and 6124640.
- `score_table1_regen_v2.txt`: human Table 1 scoring, including the separate
  tantan `-w 2000` extra row.
- `score_maize_regen.txt`: maize scores against the three satellite catalogs.
  This output uses the post-merge scorer and is not the convention used for
  manuscript Tables 3B and 3C.
- `table3bc_replacement.md` and `table3bc_provenance.json`: complete Table
  3B/3C replacement results under the legacy manuscript convention. The scorer
  first reproduced every old-BED manuscript cell before scoring the regenerated
  BED.
- `maize_extra_evidence.json`: machine-readable output for all regenerated
  maize values not covered by the reports above: the Table 3A/3A-b BWTandem
  row, the coordinate-only post-merge sweep quoted in Section 3.3.2, and the
  whole-genome 100--200-bp merged totals quoted in Section 3.3.3. It records
  the exact reproduction command, full SHA-256 and byte size of every input,
  and the scoring conventions. Table 3A was re-scored from the regenerated BED
  under both the historical mixed rule and the consistent 1--6-bp rule; it is
  not copied from the old table. The producer is
  `../../scripts/scoring/score_maize_regen_evidence.py`.

- `bwt_human_{P,B,F,H}_p100_0363.provenance.json`: the four native
  `--max-period 100` operating-point runs behind Table 1d and Figure 1
  (the Table 1b native F arm is now only a sensitivity analysis)
  (SLURM jobs 6141841_0 and 6143150_1..3, four threads each).
- `bwt_human_idsweep_{off,0.80,0.76,0.72,0.68}_p2000_0363.provenance.json`:
  the five full-range identity-sweep arms behind Supplementary Table S3
  (SLURM job 6143151_0..4). The 0.72 arm reproduces `regen_human.bed`
  call-for-call: identical byte count and identical sorted-content SHA-256.
- `score_table1_p100.txt` and `score_table1_idsweep.txt`: Table 1 scoring of
  the runs above as `--extra` rows over the unchanged fixed baselines
  (producer `../../scripts/scoring/score_table1_regen.py`, rules
  `published,loo`). In both files every baseline row reproduces
  `score_table1_regen_v2.txt` decimal for decimal.
- `s2_F_p100.txt` and `s2_P_p100.txt`: the Supplementary Table S2
  unique-versus-shared characterisation of the F run, and the P-run control
  for its outside-catalog fraction (producer
  `../../scripts/scoring/analyze_unique_regions.py`).

To reproduce the extra maize report on a system with the recorded external
inputs mounted, run the exact command stored in its top-level `command` field.
The output is deterministic: it contains no timestamp, and rerunning it at the
same output path must reproduce the deposited file byte for byte.

Additional deposited reports include `colcen_banded_regen.txt` (current
BWTandem banded recalls), `colcen_trash_template_union.bed` and
`colcen_trash_template_scored.txt` (template-only correction), `heldout_*.txt`
(chromosome partitions), and `recip_*.txt` (overlap-rule sensitivity).
The historical BWTandem baseline printed by the Col-CEN scorer is not the
regenerated row; use the explicit `BWTandem-regen` row for current values.
Raw SLURM accounting is one directory up in `../sacct_provenance.txt`.

Full SHA-256 hashes are recorded in `../manifest.sha256`; row-level provenance
and scorer hashes are recorded in `../manifest.tsv`.
