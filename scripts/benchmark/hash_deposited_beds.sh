# results/manifest.tsv records first-megabyte hashes (sha256_1MB), which
# cannot detect truncation or tail corruption. This writes:
#   results/manifest.sha256          — whole-file hashes for everything under
#                                      results/ (plus the evidence scripts),
#                                      verifiable on any clone with
#                                      `sha256sum -c results/manifest.sha256`
#   results/external_evidence.sha256 — whole-file hashes for every manifest
#                                      source_bed that lives OUTSIDE the repo
#                                      (benchmark workspace paths); only
#                                      verifiable on the cluster, but closes
#                                      the truncation blindness for the
#                                      largest evidence files
# then verifies the in-repo manifest it just wrote.
#
# ⚠️ Run this LAST, after every other edit under results/ — a results/ file
# edited after hashing makes `sha256sum -c` fail on a fresh clone (that
# exact failure shipped in e178707).
